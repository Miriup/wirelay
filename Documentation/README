wirelay: wired's gentoo dev overlay - testing grounds and bleeding edge stuff

I no longer keep ChangeLogs in here, git log is enough
if you need to see the changes for a folder just:
	# in the directory you're interested in
	git log .
or
	# in wirelay/
	git log category/package

if you need to see the log for a specific file only:
	git log file


as of 2009/07/19 wirelay is in layman's overlay list
	layman -L
	layman -a wirelay
